Hacking is the act of compromising
digital devices and networks by gaining
unauthorized access to an account or computer system.

Ethical hacking refers to the actions carried out by
white hat security hackers. It involves gaining access
to computer systems and networks to test for potential
vulnerabilities, and then fixing any identified weaknesses.
Using these technical skills for ethical hacking purposes is
legal, provided the individual has written permission from
the system or network owner, protects the organizationâ€™s privacy,
and reports all weaknesses they find to the organization and its vendors.
